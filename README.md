# MyGradHub - Auth Service

Welcome to the **MyGradHub Auth Service** project! This microservice is responsible for handling user authentication and registration. It is built using **Spring Boot**, follows a clean architecture, and is fully containerized with Docker. Continuous Integration is managed via **GitHub Actions**, and code quality is enforced through **SonarCloud**.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

This service provides:

- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- API documentation via Swagger
- H2 database console for local development

Technologies used:

- Java 17 + Spring Boot
- Maven for build and dependency management
- H2 Database (dev)
- JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- SonarCloud for code quality and static analysis

---

## üöÄ Setup & Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose (if running containerized)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zuamirgoliveira/mygradhub.git
cd mygradhub
```

### Run locally (Dev Mode)

```bash
cd mygradhub-auth
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Run with Docker

## üïπÔ∏è Local API Access

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html)
- API Docs: [http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs](http://localhost:8081/v3/api-docs)
- H2 Console: [http://localhost:8081/h2-console](http://localhost:8081/h2-console)

### Main Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint              | Description                 | Auth Required |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------- |
| POST   | `/api/v1/auth/signup` | Register a new user         | No            |
| POST   | `/api/v1/auth/login`  | Login and receive JWT token | No            |
| GET    | `/api/v1/users`       | List all users              | Yes (JWT)     |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** approach with separation of concerns
- Follows layered architecture: `controller`, `service`, `repository`, and `model`
- Uses **@ControllerAdvice** for global exception handling
- Integrated validation with detailed error response mapping

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Continuous Integration

CI/CD is handled by **GitHub Actions**:

- Compile and test with coverage
- Static code analysis (Checkstyle, OWASP Dependency Check)
- SonarCloud analysis
- Docker image build and push to DockerHub
